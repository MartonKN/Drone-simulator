# Drone-simulator
This is an ongoing hobby project to create a simulator for a drone using the Unity gaming engine. I only included the binary file, since the source code with all the Unity files is very large.

The drone is equipped with two cameras and a few ultrasound sensors pointing in various directions. The bars above the drone show the state of the sensors. 

The long term goal is to equip the drone with a capability to avoid obstacles. The drone would sense the distance of objects in front of it by comparing the two camera pictures.
