# Drone-simulator
This is an ongoing hobby project to create a simulator for a drone using the Unity gaming engine. At this point, there is still a lot to be done. 

The drone is equipped with two cameras and a few ultrasound sensors pointing in various directions. The bars above the drone show the state of the sensors. 

The long term goal is to equip the drone with the capability to avoid obstacles.
